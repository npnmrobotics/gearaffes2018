	/*               OVERVIEW OF THE FRAMEWORK
	 * 
	 * This framework has been set up to provide a structure to make it easy to read,
	 * review, modify, and maintain the robot code. This file is an overview of how the
	 * different parts of the framework fit together.
	 * 
	 * First, it is important to understand the basic foundation provided to us with
	 * the timed robot method. There are several predefined methods in the robot.java 
	 * class. These are described in more detail in the wplib documentation. Here is a
	 * summary for review. If you don't understand this part then look at the wplib 
	 * documentation for further clarification.
	 * 
	 * robotInit 			- gets called once when the robot powers up.
	 * robotPeriodic		- gets called every 20 ms whenever the robot is powered.
	 * autonomousInit 		- gets called once when autonomous starts.
	 * autonomousPeriodic 	- gets called every 20 ms when in autonomous mode.
	 * teleopInit 			- gets called once when teleop period starts.
	 * teleopPeriodic 		- gets called every 20 ms when in teleop mode.
	 * testPeriodic 		- gets called every 20 ms when in test mode.
	 *

	private void Improvements () {
	/* Robot.java
	 *  - Support needs to be added for some controls including:
	 *      - Directional pad
	 *      - Start button
	 *      - View button
	 *      - X-box button
	 *      - Menu button
	 * 
	 * Figure out how to stop the power distribution board CAN timeout error message coming up on console 
	 * Program to allow team to test hardware functions
	 * Make logging log to a file on a USB drive in addition to the output to the console.
	 * 
	 * Autonomous.java
	 *   - Write turn blocks.
	 *   - Constant move forward. Do simple p now and put PID in later.
	 *   - Make a simple turn in place routine. Assume robot stops before it turns.
	 *   - Add gyro control to keep it going straight.
